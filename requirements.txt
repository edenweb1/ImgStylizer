diffusers>=0.27.0
transformers>=4.38.0
accelerate>=0.27.0
safetensors>=0.4.0

# ControlNet Preprocessing
controlnet_aux>=0.0.7

# Version 4.20.0 or higher is recommended to avoid issues with component parameters like 'info' or 'optional'

# Image Processing
Pillow>=9.0.0
opencv-python>=4.7.0 
# opencv-python is also often a dependency for controlnet_aux

# Replicate API Client (Optional, if using the Replicate backend)
